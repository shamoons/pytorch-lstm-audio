3536-8226-0000 IN THE LAST COMMUNICATION WHICH HE HAD RECEIVED FROM LADY MILBOROUGH SHE HAD SCOLDED HIM IN TERMS THAT WERE FOR HER SEVERE BECAUSE HE HAD NOT RETURNED TO HIS WIFE AND TAKEN HER OFF WITH HIM TO NAPLES
3536-8226-0001 AND NOW IT HAD COME TO PASS THAT HIS SOLE REMAINING ALLY MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE THE EX POLICEMAN WAS BECOMING WEARY OF HIS SERVICE
3536-8226-0002 AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MARCH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VINDICATED IN HIS FAVOUR
3536-8226-0003 IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECTED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE ENERGETIC NATURE OF HIS DISPOSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME ZEAL
3536-8226-0004 MISSUS BOZZLE WAS DISPOSED TO THINK THAT LADIES OF QUALITY AMONG WHOM MADAME T WAS ENTITLED IN HER ESTIMATION TO TAKE RANK WERE SELDOM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILLING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EARN HIS BREAD BY WATCHING THE LADY OR THE LADY'S LOVER
3536-8226-0005 AND HAD THE CASE BEEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE JUDGE ORDINARY BY MEANS OF HER HUSBAND'S EXERTIONS SHE WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLEASURE IN READING EVERY WORD OF THE EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH HER HUSBAND SHOULD HAVE BEEN EVER SO ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE LAWYERS
3536-8226-0006 A DISTINCT PROMISE OF A HUNDRED POUNDS WAS MADE TO HIM IF HE WOULD HAVE THE CHILD READY TO HAND OVER TO TREVELYAN ON TREVELYAN'S ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND
3536-8226-0007 OF COURSE IT AIN'T SAID MISSUS BOZZLE
3536-8226-0008 THE PATERNAL PARENT HAS A RIGHT TO HIS INFANTS NO DOUBT THAT WAS BOZZLE'S LAW
3536-8226-0009 HE CAN'T SUCKLE EM CAN HE
3536-8226-0010 WHEN A MARRIED WOMAN HAS FOLLOWERS AND THE HUSBAND DON'T GO THE WRONG SIDE OF THE POST TOO OR IT AIN'T PROVED AGAIN HIM THAT HE DO THEY'LL NEVER LET HER HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CHILDREN
3536-8226-0011 I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT IS B EXCLAIMED MISSUS BOZZLE IT'S MY BELIEF AS HE AIN'T QUITE RIGHT UP HERE AND MISSUS BOZZLE TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD
3536-8226-0012 DRAT EM ALL WHAT IS IT THEY WANTS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANTS
3536-8226-0013 IT'S THAT AS MAKES EM I WON'T SAY WHAT
3536-8226-0014 BUT AS FOR THIS HERE CHILD B
3536-8226-0015 TREVELYAN HAD FOLLOWED HIS LETTER QUICKER THAN HE HAD INTENDED WHEN IT WAS WRITTEN AND WAS NOW WITH HIS PRIME MINISTER BEFORE HIS PRIME MINISTER HAD BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION ON THE LAST INSTRUCTION RECEIVED
3536-8226-0016 DOES ONE MISTER SAMUEL BOZZLE LIVE HERE ASKED TREVELYAN
3536-8226-0017 THEN BOZZLE CAME FORWARD AND INTRODUCED HIS WIFE
3536-8226-0018 BUT TREVELYAN WAS OF A DIFFERENT OPINION AND HE WAS DISGUSTED AND REVOLTED MOST UNREASONABLY BY THE APPEARANCE OF HIS MINISTER'S DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS
3536-8226-0019 BOZZLE HAD ALWAYS WAITED UPON HIM WITH A DECENT COAT AND A WELL BRUSHED HAT AND CLEAN SHOES
3536-8226-0020 IT IS VERY MUCH EASIER FOR SUCH MEN AS MISTER BOZZLE TO CARRY DECENCY OF APPEARANCE ABOUT WITH THEM THAN TO KEEP IT AT HOME
3536-8226-0021 PERHAPS YOU COULD PUT ON YOUR COAT AND WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A FEW MINUTES SAID TREVELYAN
3536-8226-0022 MISSUS BOZZLE WHO WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT BUSINESS WAS BUSINESS AND THAT WIVES WERE NOT BUSINESS FELT NO ANGER AT THIS AND HANDED HER HUSBAND HIS BEST COAT
3536-8226-0023 BOZZLE AWAY FROM HIS OWN HOME OUT ON BUSINESS WITH HIS COAT BUTTONED OVER HIS BREAST AND HIS BEST HAT IN HIS HAND WAS AWARE THAT HE COMMANDED RESPECT AND HE COULD CARRY HIMSELF ACCORDINGLY
3536-8226-0024 I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT ANYBODY WILL QUESTION MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE CARE OF MY OWN CHILD SAID TREVELYAN
3536-8226-0025 IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE TO MISTER SKINT SIR SUGGESTED BOZZLE
3536-8226-0026 AS HE WENT ABOUT HIS EYES WERE EVER CAST DOWNWARDS AND HE WALKED WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT AND HE SUSPECTED OTHERS FEELING THAT HE HIMSELF WAS SUSPECTED
3536-8226-0027 AND ALL WORK HAD CEASED WITH HIM
3536-8226-0028 HE'S UP IN TOWN SIR A MINDING OF HIS PARLIAMENTARY DUTIES
3536-8226-0029 I'VE WATCHED AS SHARP AS WATCHING CAN GO PRETTY NEAR
3536-8226-0030 BUT IF YOU ASK ME MY OPINION WHY IN COURSE THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER SOMEWHERE
3536-8226-0031 AND BOZZLE AS HE SAID THIS SMILED ALMOST ALOUD
3536-8226-0032 AND HE DID GO AWAY LEAVING BOZZLE STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF STONY WALK
