422-122949-0000 EVERY ELEVATION OF THE TYPE MAN HAS HITHERTO BEEN THE WORK OF AN ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY AND SO IT WILL ALWAYS BE A SOCIETY BELIEVING IN A LONG SCALE OF GRADATIONS OF RANK AND DIFFERENCES OF WORTH AMONG HUMAN BEINGS AND REQUIRING SLAVERY IN SOME FORM OR OTHER
422-122949-0001 THE DISTINCTIONS OF MORAL VALUES HAVE EITHER ORIGINATED IN A RULING CASTE PLEASANTLY CONSCIOUS OF BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE RULED OR AMONG THE RULED CLASS THE SLAVES AND DEPENDENTS OF ALL SORTS
422-122949-0002 WE TRUTHFUL ONES THE NOBILITY IN ANCIENT GREECE CALLED THEMSELVES
422-122949-0003 IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERYWHERE THE DESIGNATIONS OF MORAL VALUE WERE AT FIRST APPLIED TO MEN AND WERE ONLY DERIVATIVELY AND AT A LATER PERIOD APPLIED TO ACTIONS IT IS A GROSS MISTAKE THEREFORE WHEN HISTORIANS OF MORALS START WITH QUESTIONS LIKE WHY HAVE SYMPATHETIC ACTIONS BEEN PRAISED
422-122949-0004 HE HONOURS WHATEVER HE RECOGNIZES IN HIMSELF SUCH MORALITY EQUALS SELF GLORIFICATION
422-122949-0005 PROBABLY A PESSIMISTIC SUSPICION WITH REGARD TO THE ENTIRE SITUATION OF MAN WILL FIND EXPRESSION PERHAPS A CONDEMNATION OF MAN TOGETHER WITH HIS SITUATION
422-122949-0006 HERE IS THE SEAT OF THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS ANTITHESIS GOOD AND EVIL POWER AND DANGEROUSNESS ARE ASSUMED TO RESIDE IN THE EVIL A CERTAIN DREADFULNESS SUBTLETY AND STRENGTH WHICH DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING DESPISED
422-122949-0007 ACCORDING TO SLAVE MORALITY THEREFORE THE EVIL MAN AROUSES FEAR ACCORDING TO MASTER MORALITY IT IS PRECISELY THE GOOD MAN WHO AROUSES FEAR AND SEEKS TO AROUSE IT WHILE THE BAD MAN IS REGARDED AS THE DESPICABLE BEING
422-122949-0008 EVERYWHERE THAT SLAVE MORALITY GAINS THE ASCENDANCY LANGUAGE SHOWS A TENDENCY TO APPROXIMATE THE SIGNIFICATIONS OF THE WORDS GOOD AND STUPID
422-122949-0009 OR HE WILL EVEN SAY FOR MANY REASONS I CAN DELIGHT IN THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS PERHAPS BECAUSE I LOVE AND HONOUR THEM AND REJOICE IN ALL THEIR JOYS PERHAPS ALSO BECAUSE THEIR GOOD OPINION ENDORSES AND STRENGTHENS MY BELIEF IN MY OWN GOOD OPINION PERHAPS BECAUSE THE GOOD OPINION OF OTHERS EVEN IN CASES WHERE I DO NOT SHARE IT IS USEFUL TO ME OR GIVES PROMISE OF USEFULNESS ALL THIS HOWEVER IS NOT VANITY
422-122949-0010 IN FACT CONFORMABLY TO THE SLOW RISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIAL ORDER AND ITS CAUSE THE BLENDING OF THE BLOOD OF MASTERS AND SLAVES THE ORIGINALLY NOBLE AND RARE IMPULSE OF THE MASTERS TO ASSIGN A VALUE TO THEMSELVES AND TO THINK WELL OF THEMSELVES WILL NOW BE MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED AND EXTENDED BUT IT HAS AT ALL TIMES AN OLDER AMPLER AND MORE RADICALLY INGRAINED PROPENSITY OPPOSED TO IT AND IN THE PHENOMENON OF VANITY THIS OLDER PROPENSITY OVERMASTERS THE YOUNGER
422-122949-0011 THE MOST VARIED EXPERIENCE TEACHES IT WHAT ARE THE QUALITIES TO WHICH IT PRINCIPALLY OWES THE FACT THAT IT STILL EXISTS IN SPITE OF ALL GODS AND MEN AND HAS HITHERTO BEEN VICTORIOUS THESE QUALITIES IT CALLS VIRTUES AND THESE VIRTUES ALONE IT DEVELOPS TO MATURITY
422-122949-0012 VARIATIONS WHETHER THEY BE DEVIATIONS INTO THE HIGHER FINER AND RARER OR DETERIORATIONS AND MONSTROSITIES APPEAR SUDDENLY ON THE SCENE IN THE GREATEST EXUBERANCE AND SPLENDOUR THE INDIVIDUAL DARES TO BE INDIVIDUAL AND DETACH HIMSELF
422-122949-0013 AT THIS TURNING POINT OF HISTORY THERE MANIFEST THEMSELVES SIDE BY SIDE AND OFTEN MIXED AND ENTANGLED TOGETHER A MAGNIFICENT MANIFOLD VIRGIN FOREST LIKE UP GROWTH AND UP STRIVING A KIND OF TROPICAL TEMPO IN THE RIVALRY OF GROWTH AND AN EXTRAORDINARY DECAY AND SELF DESTRUCTION OWING TO THE SAVAGELY OPPOSING AND SEEMINGLY EXPLODING EGOISMS WHICH STRIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER FOR SUN AND LIGHT AND CAN NO LONGER ASSIGN ANY LIMIT RESTRAINT OR FORBEARANCE FOR THEMSELVES BY MEANS OF THE HITHERTO EXISTING MORALITY
422-122949-0014 NOTHING BUT NEW WHYS NOTHING BUT NEW HOWS NO COMMON FORMULAS ANY LONGER MISUNDERSTANDING AND DISREGARD IN LEAGUE WITH EACH OTHER DECAY DETERIORATION AND THE LOFTIEST DESIRES FRIGHTFULLY ENTANGLED THE GENIUS OF THE RACE OVERFLOWING FROM ALL THE CORNUCOPIAS OF GOOD AND BAD A PORTENTOUS SIMULTANEOUSNESS OF SPRING AND AUTUMN FULL OF NEW CHARMS AND MYSTERIES PECULIAR TO THE FRESH STILL INEXHAUSTED STILL UNWEARIED CORRUPTION
422-122949-0015 DANGER IS AGAIN PRESENT THE MOTHER OF MORALITY GREAT DANGER THIS TIME SHIFTED INTO THE INDIVIDUAL INTO THE NEIGHBOUR AND FRIEND INTO THE STREET INTO THEIR OWN CHILD INTO THEIR OWN HEART INTO ALL THE MOST PERSONAL AND SECRET RECESSES OF THEIR DESIRES AND VOLITIONS
422-122949-0016 WHAT WILL THE MORAL PHILOSOPHERS WHO APPEAR AT THIS TIME HAVE TO PREACH
422-122949-0017 THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF RACE
422-122949-0018 IN OUR VERY DEMOCRATIC OR RATHER VERY PLEBEIAN AGE EDUCATION AND CULTURE MUST BE ESSENTIALLY THE ART OF DECEIVING DECEIVING WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN WITH REGARD TO THE INHERITED PLEBEIANISM IN BODY AND SOUL
422-122949-0019 THE NOBLE SOUL ACCEPTS THE FACT OF HIS EGOISM WITHOUT QUESTION AND ALSO WITHOUT CONSCIOUSNESS OF HARSHNESS CONSTRAINT OR ARBITRARINESS THEREIN BUT RATHER AS SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE ITS BASIS IN THE PRIMARY LAW OF THINGS IF HE SOUGHT A DESIGNATION FOR IT HE WOULD SAY IT IS JUSTICE ITSELF
422-122949-0020 ON THIS ACCOUNT THE PEOPLE OF ONE NATION UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER BETTER THAN THOSE BELONGING TO DIFFERENT NATIONS EVEN WHEN THEY USE THE SAME LANGUAGE OR RATHER WHEN PEOPLE HAVE LIVED LONG TOGETHER UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS OF CLIMATE SOIL DANGER REQUIREMENT TOIL THERE ORIGINATES THEREFROM AN ENTITY THAT UNDERSTANDS ITSELF NAMELY A NATION
422-122949-0021 THE GREATER THE DANGER THE GREATER IS THE NEED OF AGREEING QUICKLY AND READILY ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY NOT TO MISUNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER IN DANGER THAT IS WHAT CANNOT AT ALL BE DISPENSED WITH IN INTERCOURSE
422-122949-0022 ALSO IN ALL LOVES AND FRIENDSHIPS ONE HAS THE EXPERIENCE THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND CONTINUES WHEN THE DISCOVERY HAS BEEN MADE THAT IN USING THE SAME WORDS ONE OF THE TWO PARTIES HAS FEELINGS THOUGHTS INTUITIONS WISHES OR FEARS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE OTHER
422-122949-0023 WHICHEVER GROUPS OF SENSATIONS WITHIN A SOUL AWAKEN MOST READILY BEGIN TO SPEAK AND GIVE THE WORD OF COMMAND THESE DECIDE AS TO THE GENERAL ORDER OF RANK OF ITS VALUES AND DETERMINE ULTIMATELY ITS LIST OF DESIRABLE THINGS
422-122949-0024 A MAN'S ESTIMATES OF VALUE BETRAY SOMETHING OF THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SOUL AND WHEREIN IT SEES ITS CONDITIONS OF LIFE ITS INTRINSIC NEEDS
422-122949-0025 PROFOUND SUFFERING MAKES NOBLE IT SEPARATES ONE OF THE MOST REFINED FORMS OF DISGUISE IS EPICURISM ALONG WITH A CERTAIN OSTENTATIOUS BOLDNESS OF TASTE WHICH TAKES SUFFERING LIGHTLY AND PUTS ITSELF ON THE DEFENSIVE AGAINST ALL THAT IS SORROWFUL AND PROFOUND
422-122949-0026 THE HIGHEST INSTINCT FOR PURITY PLACES HIM WHO IS AFFECTED WITH IT IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY AND DANGEROUS ISOLATION AS A SAINT FOR IT IS JUST HOLINESS THE HIGHEST SPIRITUALIZATION OF THE INSTINCT IN QUESTION
422-122949-0027 OCCASIONALLY TOO THE WAKING CALL COMES TOO LATE THE CHANCE WHICH GIVES PERMISSION TO TAKE ACTION WHEN THEIR BEST YOUTH AND STRENGTH FOR ACTION HAVE BEEN USED UP IN SITTING STILL AND HOW MANY A ONE JUST AS HE SPRANG UP HAS FOUND WITH HORROR THAT HIS LIMBS ARE BENUMBED AND HIS SPIRITS ARE NOW TOO HEAVY
422-122949-0028 AND WHOEVER THOU ART WHAT IS IT THAT NOW PLEASES THEE
422-122949-0029 ONLY NAME IT WHATEVER I HAVE I OFFER THEE
422-122949-0030 BUT YOU MISUNDERSTAND HIM WHEN YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
422-122949-0031 THERE MUST BE A SORT OF REPUGNANCE IN ME TO BELIEVE ANYTHING DEFINITE ABOUT MYSELF IS THERE PERHAPS SOME ENIGMA THEREIN
422-122949-0032 PROBABLY BUT FORTUNATELY NOTHING FOR MY OWN TEETH PERHAPS IT BETRAYS THE SPECIES TO WHICH I BELONG BUT NOT TO MYSELF AS IS SUFFICIENTLY AGREEABLE TO ME BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU
422-122949-0033 I DO NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY PERHAPS THE HARPIES HAVE FLOWN OVER MY TABLE
422-122949-0034 TO SUFFOCATE WITH HIS MEMORIES TO HIM WHO HAS THE DESIRES OF A LOFTY AND DAINTY SOUL AND ONLY SELDOM FINDS HIS TABLE LAID AND HIS FOOD PREPARED THE DANGER WILL ALWAYS BE GREAT NOWADAYS HOWEVER IT IS EXTRAORDINARILY SO
422-122949-0035 AND TO CHOOSE FOR COMPANY THAT ROGUISH AND CHEERFUL VICE POLITENESS
