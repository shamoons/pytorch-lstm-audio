5694-64029-0006 SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TRUST A SECESH ON HIS WORD OATH OR BOND MARCH I SAY
5694-64029-0007 I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE RELIEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHOOT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
5694-64029-0008 MY GUN WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
5694-64029-0009 I MADE A QUICK GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER AND GRABBED AT MY GUN
5694-64029-0010 HE DIVINED MY MOTIVE AND FIRED THE BALL MISSED ITS AIM
5694-64029-0011 I THINK WE MUST HAVE KILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIRING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOLID LINE AS THEY ADVANCED UPON US
5694-64029-0012 WE KEPT FALLING BACK AND FIRING ALL DAY AND WERE RELIEVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT ABOUT DARK WE REJOINED OUR REGIMENT
5694-64029-0013 LINE OF BATTLE WAS FORMED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE'S RIVER ON THE YANKEE SIDE
5694-64029-0014 BAD GENERALSHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS
5694-64029-0015 THE PRIVATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
5694-64029-0016 I CALLED LIEUTENANT COLONEL FRIERSON'S ATTENTION TO THE YANKEES AND HE REMARKED WELL I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE YANKEES OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHTY QUICK

5694-64029-0020 WE WERE NOT TWENTY YARDS OFF FROM THE YANKEES AND THEY WERE POURING THE HOT SHOT AND SHELLS RIGHT INTO OUR RANKS AND EVERY MAN WAS YELLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN CEASE FIRING YOU ARE FIRING ON YOUR OWN MEN
5694-64029-0021 OAKLEY COLOR BEARER OF THE FOURTH TENNESSEE REGIMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MIDST OF THE YANKEE LINE WITH HIS COLORS BEGGING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
5694-64029-0022 THE LEADEN HAIL STORM SWEPT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORMED
5694-64029-0023 WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED YARDS IN ADVANCE OF THE BRIGADE CHEATHAM ALL THE TIME CALLING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
5694-64029-0024 I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR GLORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
5694-64029-0025 I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TORN FROM MY SHOULDER
5694-64029-0026 AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HOSPITAL I OVERTOOK ANOTHER MAN WALKING ALONG
5694-64029-0027 I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
5694-64029-0028 HE WAS WALKING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DROPPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STRUGGLE OR A GROAN
5694-64029-0029 BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WEARING DEAD MEN'S SHOES
5694-64029-0030 HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DROPPED THAT FOOT QUICK
