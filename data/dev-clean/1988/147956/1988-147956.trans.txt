1988-147956-0000 FUCHS BROUGHT UP A SACK OF POTATOES AND A PIECE OF CURED PORK FROM THE CELLAR AND GRANDMOTHER PACKED SOME LOAVES OF SATURDAY'S BREAD A JAR OF BUTTER AND SEVERAL PUMPKIN PIES IN THE STRAW OF THE WAGON BOX
1988-147956-0001 OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THE HORSES WOULD TEAR OFF WITH HIS TEETH A PLANT FULL OF BLOSSOMS AND WALK ALONG MUNCHING IT THE FLOWERS NODDING IN TIME TO HIS BITES AS HE ATE DOWN TOWARD THEM
1988-147956-0002 IT'S NO BETTER THAN A BADGER HOLE NO PROPER DUGOUT AT ALL
1988-147956-0003 NOW WHY IS THAT OTTO
1988-147956-0004 PRESENTLY AGAINST ONE OF THOSE BANKS I SAW A SORT OF SHED THATCHED WITH THE SAME WINE COLORED GRASS THAT GREW EVERYWHERE
1988-147956-0005 VERY GLAD VERY GLAD SHE EJACULATED
1988-147956-0006 YOU'LL GET FIXED UP COMFORTABLE AFTER WHILE MISSUS SHIMERDA MAKE GOOD HOUSE
1988-147956-0007 MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TONE TO FOREIGNERS AS IF THEY WERE DEAF
1988-147956-0008 SHE MADE MISSUS SHIMERDA UNDERSTAND THE FRIENDLY INTENTION OF OUR VISIT AND THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN HANDLED THE LOAVES OF BREAD AND EVEN SMELLED THEM AND EXAMINED THE PIES WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY EXCLAIMING MUCH GOOD MUCH THANK
1988-147956-0009 THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORNCAKES AND SORGHUM MOLASSES FOR THREE DAYS
1988-147956-0010 I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES
1988-147956-0011 HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR
1988-147956-0012 EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY
1988-147956-0013 HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS ARE SMART
1988-147956-0014 AMBROSCH HE MAKE GOOD FARMER
1988-147956-0015 HE STRUCK AMBROSCH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY
1988-147956-0016 AT THAT MOMENT THE FATHER CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK
1988-147956-0017 IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAITS I REMEMBERED IN VIRGINIA
1988-147956-0018 I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE
1988-147956-0019 WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US
1988-147956-0020 THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM
1988-147956-0021 SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY
1988-147956-0022 SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTTONWOOD TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME
1988-147956-0023 ANTONIA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH HER GLANCE
1988-147956-0024 SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND WRUNG HER HANDS
1988-147956-0025 SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAGER
1988-147956-0026 WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US
1988-147956-0027 AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASED SILVER RING SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER
1988-147956-0028 WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS
1988-147956-0029 I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY ELDERS
