2086-149214-0000 THE NARRATIVE IT MAY BE IS WOVEN OF SO HUMBLE A TEXTURE AS TO REQUIRE THIS ADVANTAGE AND AT THE SAME TIME TO RENDER IT THE MORE DIFFICULT OF ATTAINMENT
2086-149214-0001 IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER HE IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY IMAGINATIVE TO FLATTER HIMSELF WITH THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF THIS KIND
2086-149214-0002 THE AUTHOR HAS CONSIDERED IT HARDLY WORTH HIS WHILE THEREFORE RELENTLESSLY TO IMPALE THE STORY WITH ITS MORAL AS WITH AN IRON ROD OR RATHER AS BY STICKING A PIN THROUGH A BUTTERFLY THUS AT ONCE DEPRIVING IT OF LIFE AND CAUSING IT TO STIFFEN IN AN UNGAINLY AND UNNATURAL ATTITUDE
2086-149214-0003 IF PERMITTED BY THE HISTORICAL CONNECTION WHICH THOUGH SLIGHT WAS ESSENTIAL TO HIS PLAN THE AUTHOR WOULD VERY WILLINGLY HAVE AVOIDED ANYTHING OF THIS NATURE
2086-149214-0004 HE TRUSTS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED AS UNPARDONABLY OFFENDING BY LAYING OUT A STREET THAT INFRINGES UPON NOBODY'S PRIVATE RIGHTS AND APPROPRIATING A LOT OF LAND WHICH HAD NO VISIBLE OWNER AND BUILDING A HOUSE OF MATERIALS LONG IN USE FOR CONSTRUCTING CASTLES IN THE AIR
