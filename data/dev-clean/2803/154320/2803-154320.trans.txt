2803-154320-0000 FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN
2803-154320-0001 JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG
2803-154320-0002 THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM
2803-154320-0003 THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED
2803-154320-0004 MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS
2803-154320-0005 HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON
2803-154320-0006 WHAT THEN MY LORD
2803-154320-0007 GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN
2803-154320-0008 WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN
2803-154320-0009 YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN
2803-154320-0010 WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT
2803-154320-0011 THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT
2803-154320-0012 WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN
2803-154320-0013 SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER
2803-154320-0014 BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID
