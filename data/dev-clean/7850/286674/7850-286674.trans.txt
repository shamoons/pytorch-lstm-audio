7850-286674-0000 A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
7850-286674-0001 IT IS DISGRACEFUL
7850-286674-0002 THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL
7850-286674-0003 THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS
7850-286674-0004 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
7850-286674-0005 THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES
7850-286674-0006 BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE
7850-286674-0007 WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH
7850-286674-0008 OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER
7850-286674-0009 THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
7850-286674-0010 INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD
7850-286674-0011 BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY
7850-286674-0012 SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE
7850-286674-0013 HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE
7850-286674-0014 SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT
7850-286674-0015 THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER
7850-286674-0016 HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL
7850-286674-0017 THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY
