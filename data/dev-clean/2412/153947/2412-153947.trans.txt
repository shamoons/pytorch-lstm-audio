2412-153947-0000 PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
2412-153947-0001 THIS IS A MISTAKE THOUGH A PERFECTLY NATURAL ONE
2412-153947-0002 ON MY RETURN I PURPOSELY AVOIDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REVISES TO THE PRINTER
2412-153947-0003 THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPRISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINTS OF SIMILARITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOKS IN SPITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDEPENDENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
2412-153947-0004 I REGRET THAT REVIEWERS HAVE IN SOME CASES BEEN INCLINED TO TREAT THE CHAPTERS ON MACHINES AS AN ATTEMPT TO REDUCE MISTER DARWIN'S THEORY TO AN ABSURDITY
2412-153947-0005 I AM SURPRISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPECIOUS MISUSE OF ANALOGY WOULD SEEM MOST NATURALLY LEVELLED SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED TO NO REVIEWER NEITHER SHALL I MENTION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FANCY THAT THE HINT GIVEN WILL SUFFICE
2412-153947-0006 BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMPLAIN FOR I WAS ALLOWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DECEIVERS TO THEIR FACES AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
2412-153947-0007 I MUST NOT CONCLUDE WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY MOST SINCERE THANKS TO MY CRITICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LENIENCY AND CONSIDERATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREATED MY ADVENTURES
2412-153947-0008 IT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UPPER RANGITATA DISTRICT OF THE CANTERBURY PROVINCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW ZEALAND AND APPEARED AT CHRISTCHURCH IN THE PRESS NEWSPAPER JUNE THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
2412-153947-0009 I ALSO WROTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT ULTIMATELY BECAME THE MUSICAL BANKS AND THE TRIAL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONSUMPTION
2412-153947-0010 I SEE FROM MY SECOND PREFACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO MESSRS CHAPMAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE AND ON THEIR REJECTION OF IT UNDER THE ADVICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATTAINED THE HIGHEST RANK AMONG LIVING WRITERS I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TRUBNER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO
2412-153947-0011 I ATTRIBUTE ITS UNLOOKED FOR SUCCESS MAINLY TO TWO EARLY FAVOURABLE REVIEWS THE FIRST IN THE PALL MALL GAZETTE OF APRIL TWELFTH AND THE SECOND IN THE SPECTATOR OF APRIL TWENTIETH
2412-153947-0012 THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE
2412-153947-0013 THE FIRST EDITION OF EREWHON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS I HAD NOT TAKEN MOULDS AND AS THE DEMAND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
2412-153947-0014 I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRIFLING ALTERATIONS BEFORE MOULDS WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AS NEW EDITIONS WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED FROM STEREOS THEN MADE
2412-153947-0015 I AM STILL FAIRLY WELL SATISFIED WITH THOSE PARTS OF EREWHON THAT WERE REPEATEDLY REWRITTEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SINGLE WRITING I WOULD GLADLY CUT OUT SOME FORTY OR FIFTY PAGES IF I COULD
2412-153947-0016 THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE COPYRIGHT WILL PROBABLY EXPIRE IN A LITTLE OVER TWELVE YEARS
