2277-149897-0000 WHEN HURSTWOOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREATER QUANDARY THAN EVER
2277-149897-0001 HE COULD HARDLY REALISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
2277-149897-0002 NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AGREED TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
2277-149897-0003 HE SAW THAT IN THE EXCITEMENT OF RECENT EVENTS HE HAD NOT FORMULATED A PLAN UPON THAT SCORE
2277-149897-0004 HE WAS GETTING SOME VAGUE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD CIGAR BUT IT WAS NO PANACEA FOR THE ILL WHICH AFFECTED HIM
2277-149897-0005 IT WAS WITH GREAT OPPOSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST URGENT MENTAL AFFIRMATION AND DENIAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN ENVELOPE PLACED IN IT THE REQUESTED AMOUNT AND SLOWLY SEALED IT UP
2277-149897-0006 THEN HE CALLED HARRY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
2277-149897-0007 YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADDRESS HE SAID HANDING HIM THE ENVELOPE AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HURSTWOOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
2277-149897-0008 ANY ANSWER I GUESS NOT
2277-149897-0009 THE BOY HASTENED AWAY AND THE MANAGER FELL TO HIS MUSINGS
2277-149897-0010 HE WAS BEATEN FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
2277-149897-0011 SHE WOULD TAKE THE ENVELOPE AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRIUMPHED
2277-149897-0012 IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULDN'T SEND IT
2277-149897-0013 FOR RELIEF HE AROSE AND JOINED IN CONVERSATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINKING
2277-149897-0014 ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SCENE BEING THEREIN ENACTED
2277-149897-0015 IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUARTERS THE BOY RETURNED
2277-149897-0016 HE FANCIED AS HE SAT AT HIS DESK THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEEK OR TWO MEANWHILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
2277-149897-0017 HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FAILURE TO MEET OR WRITE HIM RAPIDLY INCREASED AS HE DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT
2277-149897-0018 HE DECIDED TO WRITE HER CARE OF THE WEST SIDE POST OFFICE AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
2277-149897-0019 THREE O'CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
2277-149897-0020 THE HELPLESS MANAGER PACED THE FLOOR AND GRIMLY ENDURED THE GLOOM OF DEFEAT
2277-149897-0021 HE SAW A BUSY SATURDAY USHERED OUT THE SABBATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
2277-149897-0022 ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSED HE BROODED ALONE SHUT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXCITEMENT OF HIS RESORT FROM CARRIE AND WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ALTER HIS CONDITION ONE IOTA
2277-149897-0023 IT WAS THE WORST SUNDAY HE HAD SPENT IN HIS LIFE
2277-149897-0024 IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLES WERE JUST BEGINNING
2277-149897-0025 HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MARRIED AND WAS ANGERED AT HIS PERFIDY
2277-149897-0026 HE HAD LOVED HER EARNESTLY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING HER STARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE
2277-149897-0027 HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMPLICATIONS
2277-149897-0028 HE WOULD EXPLAIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEEDED HER
2277-149897-0029 HE DID MANAGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MOOD TO GO OUT TO CARRIE BUT WHEN HE GOT IN OGDEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCHING HIM AND WENT AWAY
2277-149897-0030 HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BLOCK OF THE HOUSE
2277-149897-0031 HE TROUBLED OVER MANY LITTLE DETAILS AND TALKED PERFUNCTORILY TO EVERYBODY
2277-149897-0032 HE STAYED AT HIS DESK LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QUITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCHMAN ON HIS ROUND PULLED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SAFELY LOCKED
2277-149897-0033 ON WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POLITE NOTE FROM MC GREGOR JAMES AND HAY IT READ
2277-149897-0034 DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INSTRUCTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW THURSDAY AT ONE O'CLOCK BEFORE FILING SUIT AGAINST YOU ON BEHALF OF MISSUS JULIA HURSTWOOD FOR DIVORCE AND ALIMONY

2277-149897-0036 SO HERE IT WAS SPREAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
