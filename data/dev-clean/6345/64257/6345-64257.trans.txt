6345-64257-0000 WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEENIE AND WENT TO HER CHAMBER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PARENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALKING ALONG TO HER TOMB
6345-64257-0001 AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOTED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINUTE DETAIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE STAIR AND THROUGH THE NARROWED WAYS AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RAVED ALIKE ABOUT THE NEW GRAVE AND THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LATTER FOR ALL THE BALES BANKED AGAINST THE WALLS IT FOUND MANY A CHINK OF ENTRANCE
6345-64257-0002 WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEENIE UNDESIRED HAD KINDLED THERE STARTLED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UNNATURAL UNCANNY BECAUSE IT WAS CHEERFUL
6345-64257-0003 SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEARTH AND IN SAD DREAMY MOOD LISTENED TO THE HOWLING SWOOPS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QUIVER AND SHAKE
6345-64257-0004 THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD RECALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WAKING FROM IT WITH A CRY
6345-64257-0005 SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
6345-64257-0006 IT WAS A SUMMER NIGHT AND THE GUESTS WERE WANDERING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AMID LOVELY THINGS OF ALL COLORS AND ODORS
6345-64257-0007 BUT SHE KNEW NOBODY AND WANDERED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPPRESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
6345-64257-0008 AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOMBS
6345-64257-0009 SHE ENTERED AND THE SERVANTS SOFT FOOTED AND SILENT WERE BUSY CARRYING AWAY THE VESSELS OF HOSPITALITY AND RESTORING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREPARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MORROW NO ONE HEEDED HER
6345-64257-0010 SHE WAS LOST LOST UTTERLY WITH AN ETERNAL LOSS
6345-64257-0011 SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOWHERE TO GO NOWHERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
6345-64257-0012 BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET
6345-64257-0013 SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
6345-64257-0014 HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GREETING
6345-64257-0015 I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO WAKING
6345-64257-0016 THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICKER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUER BECAUSE MORE SHADOWY
6345-64257-0017 HER ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST
6345-64257-0018 SHALL I POUR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST A FUME FROM MY OWN BRAIN
6345-64257-0019 THUS WAS SHE BORNE AWAY CAPTIVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILLING NOR UNWILLING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQUALLY CARELESS
6345-64257-0020 WITH THAT CAME A PANG OF INTENSE PAIN
