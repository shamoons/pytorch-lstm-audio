2035-147961-0003 WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
2035-147961-0004 THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILLSIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COLOR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
2035-147961-0005 THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEFEATED ARMIES RETREATING OR OF GHOSTS WHO WERE TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET IN FOR SHELTER AND THEN WENT MOANING ON
2035-147961-0006 I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
2035-147961-0007 THE SHARP SMELL OF SPIRITS WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
2035-147961-0008 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESPISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIMPLE AND DOCILE
2035-147961-0009 THE SICK MAN RAGED AND SHOOK HIS FIST
2035-147961-0010 HE SEEMED TO BE CURSING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONGED HIM
2035-147961-0011 QUICKLY IT WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT RED SPOTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
2035-147961-0012 HE LAY PATIENTLY FIGHTING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CROUP
2035-147961-0013 ANTONIA'S FATHER UNCOVERED ONE OF HIS LONG BONY LEGS AND RUBBED IT RHYTHMICALLY

2035-147961-0028 TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH
2035-147961-0029 NOW HIS MIDDLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRAGGED BY THE OTHER TWO
2035-147961-0030 PAVEL KNOCKED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLEDGE AND THREW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
2035-147961-0031 PETER CROUCHING IN THE FRONT SEAT SAW NOTHING
2035-147961-0032 THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOTICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BROKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LOUDER THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MONASTERY OF THEIR OWN VILLAGE RINGING FOR EARLY PRAYERS
2035-147961-0033 THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILLAGE
2035-147961-0034 WHEREVER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM

2035-147961-0038 THE LOSS OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEPRESSING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SHIMERDA
