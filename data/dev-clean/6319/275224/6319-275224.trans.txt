6319-275224-0000 WHAT A FUSS IS MADE ABOUT YOU MY DEAR LITTLE FRIENDS
6319-275224-0001 YOU SURELY CANNOT SUPPOSE THAT IN A NATURAL STATE YOU WOULD BE FORCED TO CLIMB REGULARLY UP ONE TALL BARE STICK SUCH AS I SEE YOU UPON NOW
6319-275224-0002 YOUR COUSIN THE WILD CONVOLVULUS WHOM I LEFT IN THE FIELDS THIS MORNING DOES NO SUCH THING I ASSURE YOU
6319-275224-0003 MY YOUNG PLANTS REQUIRE HEAT OR THEY WOULD NOT LIVE AND THE POTS WE ARE KEPT IN PROTECT US FROM THOSE CRUEL WIRE WORMS WHO DELIGHT TO DESTROY OUR ROOTS
6319-275224-0004 WHY NOT ALLOW YOUR SILVER TUFTS TO LUXURIATE IN A NATURAL MANNER
6319-275224-0005 STILL THE ROSE TREE STOOD OUT THAT THERE MUST BE SOME GREAT ADVANTAGES IN A GARDENER'S CARE FOR SHE COULD NOT PRETEND TO BE IGNORANT OF HER OWN SUPERIORITY TO ALL HER WILD RELATIONS IN THE WOODS
6319-275224-0006 THEN THE WIND TOOK ANOTHER FROLIC ROUND THE GARDEN AND MADE UP TO THE LARGE WHITE LILY INTO WHOSE REFINED EAR HE WHISPERED A DOUBT AS TO THE NECESSITY OR ADVANTAGE OF HER THICK POWERFUL STEM BEING PROPPED UP AGAINST A STUPID UGLY STICK
6319-275224-0007 HE REALLY GRIEVED TO SEE IT
6319-275224-0008 DID THAT LOVELY CREATURE SUPPOSE THAT NATURE WHO HAD DONE SO MUCH FOR HER THAT THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY EXTENDED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD HAD YET LEFT HER SO WEAK AND FEEBLE THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF IN THE POSITION MOST CALCULATED TO GIVE HER EASE AND PLEASURE
6319-275224-0009 INDEED NOT A FLOWER ESCAPED HIS MISCHIEVOUS SUGGESTIONS
6319-275224-0010 ECHOED THE FLOWERS TREMULOUSLY AS WITH A SORT OF FEARFUL PLEASURE THEY AWAITED HIS APPROACH
6319-275224-0011 MAKING A SORT OF EDDYING CIRCUIT ROUND THE GARDEN HE KNOCKED OVER THE CONVOLVULUS POLE TORE THE STRIPS FROM THE STICK THAT HELD UP THE WHITE LILY LOOSED ALL THE CARNATION FLOWERS FROM THEIR FASTENINGS BROKE THE ROSE TREE DOWN AND LEVELLED THE SWEET PEAS TO THE GROUND
6319-275224-0012 MEANWHILE HOW FARED IT WITH THE FLOWERS
6319-275224-0013 OH THAT SHE WERE ONCE MORE CLIMBING UP THE FRIENDLY FIR POLE
6319-275224-0014 THE HONEYSUCKLE ESCAPED NO BETTER AND THE CARNATION WAS READY TO DIE OF VEXATION AT FINDING THAT HER COVETED FREEDOM HAD LEVELLED HER TO THE DIRT
6319-275224-0015 BEFORE THE DAY CLOSED THE GARDENER CAME WHISTLING FROM HIS FARM WORK TO LOOK OVER HIS PRETTY CHARGES
6319-275224-0016 BUT FOR THE SIGHT THAT AWAITED HIM HE WAS NOT PREPARED AT ALL
6319-275224-0017 WEEDS MEANWHILE SPRANG UP AND A DREARY CONFUSION REIGNED IN THE ONCE ORDERLY AND BRILLIANT LITTLE GARDEN
6319-275224-0018 THE MISTRESS HAD RETURNED AND THE YOUNG LADY WAS WITH HER AND HURRIED AT ONCE TO HER FAVOURITE GARDEN
6319-275224-0019 IN THIS POSITION SHE REMAINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULDER
6319-275224-0020 I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MAMMA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LIFTING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLANT NEW FLOWERS AND TIE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AFRESH
