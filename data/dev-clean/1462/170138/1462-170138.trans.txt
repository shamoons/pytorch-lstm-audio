1462-170138-0000 HE HAD WRITTEN A NUMBER OF BOOKS HIMSELF AMONG THEM A HISTORY OF DANCING A HISTORY OF COSTUME A KEY TO SHAKESPEARE'S SONNETS A STUDY OF THE POETRY OF ERNEST DOWSON ET CETERA
1462-170138-0001 HUGH'S WRITTEN A DELIGHTFUL PART FOR HER AND SHE'S QUITE INEXPRESSIBLE
1462-170138-0002 I HAPPEN TO HAVE MAC CONNELL'S BOX FOR TONIGHT OR THERE'D BE NO CHANCE OF OUR GETTING PLACES
1462-170138-0003 ALEXANDER EXCLAIMED MILDLY
1462-170138-0004 MYSELF I ALWAYS KNEW SHE HAD IT IN HER
1462-170138-0005 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAINHALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP INTO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF
1462-170138-0006 WHEN THEY ENTERED THE STAGE BOX ON THE LEFT THE FIRST ACT WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE SCENE BEING THE INTERIOR OF A CABIN IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND
1462-170138-0007 AS THEY SAT DOWN A BURST OF APPLAUSE DREW ALEXANDER'S ATTENTION TO THE STAGE
1462-170138-0008 OF COURSE HILDA IS IRISH THE BURGOYNES HAVE BEEN STAGE PEOPLE FOR GENERATIONS AND SHE HAS THE IRISH VOICE
1462-170138-0009 IT'S DELIGHTFUL TO HEAR IT IN A LONDON THEATRE
1462-170138-0010 WHEN SHE BEGAN TO DANCE BY WAY OF SHOWING THE GOSSOONS WHAT SHE HAD SEEN IN THE FAIRY RINGS AT NIGHT THE HOUSE BROKE INTO A PROLONGED UPROAR
1462-170138-0011 AFTER HER DANCE SHE WITHDREW FROM THE DIALOGUE AND RETREATED TO THE DITCH WALL BACK OF PHILLY'S BURROW WHERE SHE SAT SINGING THE RISING OF THE MOON AND MAKING A WREATH OF PRIMROSES FOR HER DONKEY
1462-170138-0012 MAC CONNELL LET ME INTRODUCE MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER
1462-170138-0013 THE PLAYWRIGHT GAVE MAINHALL A CURIOUS LOOK OUT OF HIS DEEP SET FADED EYES AND MADE A WRY FACE
1462-170138-0014 HE NODDED CURTLY AND MADE FOR THE DOOR DODGING ACQUAINTANCES AS HE WENT
1462-170138-0015 I DARE SAY IT'S QUITE TRUE THAT THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANY ONE ELSE
1462-170138-0016 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
1462-170138-0017 SIR HARRY TOWNE BOWED AND SAID THAT HE HAD MET MISTER ALEXANDER AND HIS WIFE IN TOKYO
1462-170138-0018 I SAY SIR HARRY THE LITTLE GIRL'S GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE
1462-170138-0019 THE FACT IS SHE'S FEELING RATHER SEEDY POOR CHILD
1462-170138-0020 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY
1462-170138-0021 HE BOWED AS THE WARNING BELL RANG AND MAINHALL WHISPERED YOU KNOW LORD WESTMERE OF COURSE THE STOOPED MAN WITH THE LONG GRAY MUSTACHE TALKING TO LADY DOWLE
1462-170138-0022 IN A MOMENT PEGGY WAS ON THE STAGE AGAIN AND ALEXANDER APPLAUDED VIGOROUSLY WITH THE REST
1462-170138-0023 IN THE HALF LIGHT HE LOOKED ABOUT AT THE STALLS AND BOXES AND SMILED A LITTLE CONSCIOUSLY RECALLING WITH AMUSEMENT SIR HARRY'S JUDICIAL FROWN
1462-170138-0024 HE LEANED FORWARD AND BEAMED FELICITATIONS AS WARMLY AS MAINHALL HIMSELF WHEN AT THE END OF THE PLAY SHE CAME AGAIN AND AGAIN BEFORE THE CURTAIN PANTING A LITTLE AND FLUSHED HER EYES DANCING AND HER EAGER NERVOUS LITTLE MOUTH TREMULOUS WITH EXCITEMENT
1462-170138-0025 ALL THE SAME HE LIFTED HIS GLASS HERE'S TO YOU LITTLE HILDA
1462-170138-0026 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD HER OWN SINCE
1462-170138-0027 IT WAS YOUTH AND POVERTY AND PROXIMITY AND EVERYTHING WAS YOUNG AND KINDLY
