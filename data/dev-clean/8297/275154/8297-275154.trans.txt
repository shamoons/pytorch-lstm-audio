8297-275154-0000 NOT HAVING HEARD FROM CAPTAIN BENNYDECK FOR SOME LITTLE TIME RANDAL THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE IN SYDNEY'S INTERESTS TO MAKE INQUIRIES AT HIS CLUB
8297-275154-0001 THE SAILING MASTER ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD ORDERS TO TAKE THE VESSEL BACK TO HER PORT WITH NO OTHER EXPLANATION THAN THAT THE CRUISE WAS OVER
8297-275154-0002 THIS ALTERNATIVE IN THE CAPTAIN'S PLANS TERMINATING THE VOYAGE A MONTH EARLIER THAN HIS ARRANGEMENTS HAD CONTEMPLATED PUZZLED RANDAL

8297-275154-0005 HAD HER BEAUTY FASCINATED HIM
8297-275154-0006 RANDAL WROTE TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION DETERMINING TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE APPOINTED HOUR AND TO QUESTION CATHERINE PRIVATELY WITHOUT GIVING HER THE ADVANTAGE OVER HIM OF PREPARING HERSELF FOR THE INTERVIEW
8297-275154-0007 AFTER MONTHS OF SEPARATION HE RECEIVED A VISIT FROM HERBERT
8297-275154-0008 YOU DISTRESS ME HERBERT MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY
8297-275154-0009 HE DRANK THE WINE GREEDILY
8297-275154-0010 WHATEVER REVIVING EFFECT IT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE PRODUCED ON HIM IT MADE NO CHANGE IN THE THREATENING GLOOM OF HIS MANNER
8297-275154-0011 HE PUT DOWN THE EMPTY GLASS TAKING NO NOTICE OF HIS BROTHER'S QUESTION
8297-275154-0012 RANDAL HE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE SYDNEY IS
8297-275154-0013 I WILL DO NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER
8297-275154-0014 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE USED TO SEEING A PRETTY CREATURE ALWAYS NICELY DRESSED ALWAYS ABOUT THE ROOM THINKING SO MUCH OF YOU AND SO LITTLE OF HERSELF AND THEN TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I AM LEFT OUT IN THE DARK
8297-275154-0015 I'M ALONE DO YOU HEAR THAT ALONE
8297-275154-0016 I HAVEN'T COURAGE ENOUGH TO DO IT FOR MYSELF
8297-275154-0017 OH WHY DID I ENGAGE THAT GOVERNESS
8297-275154-0018 I'M AFRAID HE SAID
8297-275154-0019 I TRIED IT YESTERDAY IT SET MY BRAINS ON FIRE I'M FEELING THAT GLASS I TOOK JUST NOW
8297-275154-0020 HE PAUSED AND PUT HIS HAND TO HIS FEVERED HEAD
8297-275154-0021 WAS HIS MIND WANDERING INTO SOME OTHER TRAIN OF THOUGHT
8297-275154-0022 YOU CAN'T DO IT
8297-275154-0023 LET ME HEAR WHAT IT IS FIRST
8297-275154-0024 I FEEL FOR YOU HERBERT HE SAID WARMLY
8297-275154-0025 SHE SHALL HAVE YOUR MESSAGE ALL THAT I CAN DO TO PERSUADE HER SHALL BE DONE
8297-275154-0026 LET ME REST A LITTLE HE PLEADED IF I'M NOT IN THE WAY
8297-275154-0027 HE MENTIONED THE NAME OF ONE OF THE OLD SERVANTS AT MOUNT MORVEN WHO HAD ATTACHED HIMSELF TO RANDAL AFTER THE BREAKUP OF THE FAMILY
