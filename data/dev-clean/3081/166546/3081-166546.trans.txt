3081-166546-0000 WHEN WE TOOK OUR SEATS AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE IT WAS WITH THE FEELING OF BEING NO LONGER LOOKED UPON AS CONNECTED IN ANY WAY WITH THIS CASE
3081-166546-0001 INSTANTLY THEY ABSORBED ALL MY ATTENTION THOUGH I DARED NOT GIVE THEM A DIRECT LOOK AND CONTINUED TO OBSERVE THEM ONLY IN THE GLASS
3081-166546-0002 YES AND A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE
3081-166546-0003 THE LADY IS NOT THE MOTHER OF THE BOYS BUT THEIR AUNT
3081-166546-0004 THE BOYS BELONG TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IS A WIDOWER
3081-166546-0005 GEORGE NODDED
3081-166546-0006 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH IF THE FATHER DOES NOT
3081-166546-0007 DO THEY STILL INSIST THAT MISS CHALLONER WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE ROOM WITH THEM AT THIS TIME
3081-166546-0008 GEORGE
3081-166546-0009 HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUICIDE
3081-166546-0010 I KNOW IT SOUNDS FOOLISH BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO IMPROBABLE
3081-166546-0011 THE BOYS LOOK WIDE AWAKE ENOUGH BUT WHO CAN TELL I WOULD SOONER BELIEVE THAT
3081-166546-0012 A MAN WAS LOOKING IN FROM THE CORRIDOR BEHIND AT THE FOUR PERSONS WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING
3081-166546-0013 I INQUIRED OF GEORGE WITH MY EYES STILL ON THIS FURTIVE WATCHER
3081-166546-0014 I TOOK QUITE A FANCY TO HIM WHY
3081-166546-0015 I AM LOOKING AT HIM NOW
3081-166546-0016 JUST AN EVERYDAY DETECTIVE BUT AMBITIOUS I SUPPOSE AND QUITE ALIVE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING THOROUGH
3081-166546-0017 YES HE'S MERCURIAL IN ALL HIS MOVEMENTS
3081-166546-0018 WHAT DOES HE WANT
3081-166546-0019 I ASKED AS SOON AS GEORGE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
3081-166546-0020 HE WANTS ME TO STAND READY TO OBEY ANY SUMMONS THE POLICE MAY SEND ME
3081-166546-0021 I EMPHASISED COMPLACENTLY
3081-166546-0022 HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DETECTIVE GRYCE A MAN WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOLVING JUST SUCH BAFFLING PROBLEMS AS THESE
3081-166546-0023 HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EVIDENTLY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALLUREMENT FOR HIM
3081-166546-0024 THE TRAIL HERE MUST BE A VERY BLIND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
3081-166546-0025 I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
3081-166546-0026 HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR USUAL GREETING IN MY HURRY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPERS
3081-166546-0027 HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORTABLE CHAT
3081-166546-0028 IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRIUMPH OVER GEORGE
3081-166546-0029 THE SUGGESTION HE HAD LAUGHED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY FOOLISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASED TO CONSIDER IT
3081-166546-0030 THEIR GREETING WAS CORDIAL AND THE LINES ON THE LATTER'S FACE RELAXED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INSTINCT AND JUDGMENT SO MUCH RELIANCE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
3081-166546-0031 THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GLANCING DOWN AT THE AGED DETECTIVE'S BUNDLED UP LEGS AND GENTLY PUSHING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
3081-166546-0032 IT'S THE MOST INEXPLICABLE THERE
3081-166546-0033 BUT CLEWS THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NONE
3081-166546-0034 THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
3081-166546-0035 AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
3081-166546-0036 IT'S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GRYCE
3081-166546-0037 THE OLD MAN'S EYES SHOT FIRE AND UNCONSCIOUSLY ONE FOOT SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR
3081-166546-0038 SHE HAD NO COMPANION NEAR HER
3081-166546-0039 NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLLAPSE AND SUDDEN FALL
3081-166546-0040 IN OLDEN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BOLT FROM HEAVEN
3081-166546-0041 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GRYCE
3081-166546-0042 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESK YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SPOT WHERE SHE FELL
3081-166546-0043 A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HOVERING IN THE BACKGROUND AT ONCE STEPPED FORWARD
3081-166546-0044 HE WAS THE PLAIN FACED DETECTIVE WHO HAD SPOKEN TO GEORGE
3081-166546-0045 THIS SWEETWATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERSTOOD ONE OF HIS PROTEGES AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAVOURITE
3081-166546-0046 BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUDIED THE AFFAIR CAREFULLY
3081-166546-0047 VERY WELL THEN YOU'RE IN A POSITION TO PIONEER ME
3081-166546-0048 WELL WELL THAT'S HONEST AT ALL EVENTS
3081-166546-0049 BUT I'M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROMISES
3081-166546-0050 OLD DAYS DON'T RETURN FOR THE ASKING
3081-166546-0051 WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FINALLY SANK INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPENINGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LOBBY BELOW
3081-166546-0052 ONE OR TWO OF THE MUSICIANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
3081-166546-0053 NATURALLY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
3081-166546-0054 MARK SOWERBY AND CLAUS HENNERBERG
3081-166546-0055 HONEST GERMANS MEN WHO HAVE PLAYED HERE FOR YEARS
3081-166546-0056 WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SCENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LOBBY
3081-166546-0057 ANYBODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
3081-166546-0058 YES MISS CLARKE THE MIDDLE AGED LADY WITH THE PARRISHES
3081-166546-0059 I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CAREFULLY QUESTIONED VERY I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0060 AND SHE SPEAKS OF NO WEAPON
3081-166546-0061 NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPPILY IN HIS OFFICE IN THIS VERY BUILDING
3081-166546-0062 YES MISTER SLATER THE ASSISTANT MANAGER WHO WAS IN THE LOBBY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE ELAPSED
3081-166546-0063 NO DOUBT
3081-166546-0064 SWEETWATER SOMEONE DREW THAT WEAPON OUT
3081-166546-0065 NOT ALTOGETHER BY ME
3081-166546-0066 WHEREVER SHE PLEASES ONLY I CAN'T WALK FAR
3081-166546-0067 IT HAS NOT BEEN RUNNING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CURIOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUSTLING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THIS PLACE
3081-166546-0068 BUT THEY'LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
3081-166546-0069 VERY GOOD MANAGE IT AS YOU WILL
3081-166546-0070 I'LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU'RE READY EXPLAIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I'M AN OLD AND RHEUMATIC INVALID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS
3081-166546-0071 AS HER QUIET FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY SWEETWATER STOLE A GLANCE AT MISTER GRYCE
3081-166546-0072 THERE WAS NO DOUBTING THEM IN THIS INSTANCE
3081-166546-0073 YES
3081-166546-0074 FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MINUTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUNNING FROM THE MUSICIANS GALLERY
3081-166546-0075 YES MANY TIMES
3081-166546-0076 WHAT MADE THE DIFFERENCE
3081-166546-0077 MISS CLARKE STARTED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOWED A MOMENT'S PERPLEXITY DID I SHE QUERIED MUSINGLY
3081-166546-0078 NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
3081-166546-0079 AND THE GLANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEETING HIS EYE SHOWED THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADMISSION
3081-166546-0080 I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
3081-166546-0081 THERE WAS NO PONIARD IN THE WOUND
3081-166546-0082 THE TIME IS NARROWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CLARKE WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOUCH HER
3081-166546-0083 I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
3081-166546-0084 SWEETWATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
3081-166546-0085 BUT VIGOUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOWED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THANKED MISS CLARKE AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELEVATOR
3081-166546-0086 THE NEXT MINUTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY'S ARMS
3081-166546-0087 NO WEAPON PROTRUDED FROM THE WOUND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE MEZZANINE WHAT FOLLOWS
3081-166546-0088 SHE STRUCK THE BLOW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADDITIONAL FORCE TO PULL THE WEAPON OUT AND FLING IT FROM HER
3081-166546-0089 IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLEW THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPENINGS INTO THE LOBBY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
